    <h1>Project 2</h1>

    <img src="./Project 2_files/gtmusiclogo.jpg" width="150">

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
    The goal of Project 2 is for students to build <i>GTmyMusic</i>,
    a file/music synchronization application. Students will build both 
    client and server capable of range of different functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Due:</b> Tuesday, October 8th, 5pm EDT<br>
    <b>Points:</b> 90<br>
    <b>Teams:</b> You <i>must</i> work as a pair. Students should note that both 
    members receive the same grade.
    </p>

    <p>
    Like so many other people, your professor is frustrated with the fact that
    every machine he owns has a different collection of songs in his iTunes
    library. Students will solve this problem and develop GTmyMusic, a
    networked application that enables multiple machines to ensure that they
    have the same files in their music directory. 
    </p>

    <p> 
    Clients can send one of <b>4</b> messages to the server: 1) List Files (ask
    the server to return a list of files it currently has); 2) Diff (based on
    1)), the client should show a "diff" of the files it has in comparison to
    the server); 3) Pull (request all files identified in 2)) from the server
    and store them locally) and 4) Leave (the client should end its session
    with the server and take care of any open connections). The server must be
    multithreaded to handle multiple concurrent client requests (reads and
    writes) and store/retrieve historical information about each client in a
    file.  
    </p>

    <p>
    In particular, the following functions will need to be implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
	<li><tt>LIST</tt> 
	</li><li><tt>DIFF</tt> 
	</li><li><tt>PULL</tt> 
	</li><li><tt>LEAVE</tt> 
    </li></ul>

    <p>
    Unlike the last project, no skeleton files will be provided. However,
    I will instead provide design goals which must be met along the
    path towards implementing this project. They are:
    </p>

    <ol>
	<li> Students must develop an overview of the architecture they plan
	to build that will achieve all of the above tasks. This should be
	a written document, saved as a PDF. (5%)
	</li><li> Given the above message types, students must define one or more
	structs capable of carrying this information. (10%)
	</li><li> Students must develop a centralized server capable of dealing
	with multiple clients concurrently. You may use either pthreads
	or select(), but you must justify your decision to do so. The 
	server should indicate the current operation it is doing in the
	terminal window. Also, "diff" must actually crawl the directory
	structure and return all files in the current directory (you do
	not need to open sub-directories). (35%)
	</li><li> Students must develop a client implementing a simple 
	interface to allow a user to enter their choices. (35%)
	</li><li> Students must develop a means of robustly determining whether
	or not two files, even if named differently, contain the same
	content (without actually sending the entire file). (15%)
    </li></ol>

    <p> 
    <b>Note:</b> <font color="red"> Students should make sure that their
	design is extensible.  This project will be part of Project 4, which
	will require additional functionality and message types.</font> 
    </p>

    <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
    <p>
    Students are to turn in all their files as a single tarfile, to
    the TA via T-Square. The tarfile should be your named as follows: 
    last_last-proj2.tar.gz. To make a tarfile, I would do the following 
    on the command line: 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>tar zcvf traynor-traynor-proj2.tar.gz client.c server.c Makefile 
	proj2-architecture.pdf</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Students will need to demo their project to the TA. Demos will be
    scheduled after the assignment is turned in. Both students must turn
    in a copy of the project to T-Square (they must match) and must both
    be present at the demo. Projects that are not demoed will recieve no
    credit.
    </p>
